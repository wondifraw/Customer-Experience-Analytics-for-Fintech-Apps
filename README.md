## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive solution for analyzing customer experiences within Ethiopian fintech applications. It combines data scraping, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and visualization tools to assess user feedback and extract meaningful insights. Designed with modularity and reproducibility in mind, it supports decision-making for improving user satisfaction and app quality.

## 🎯 Project Goals and Objectives

* Scrape and collect user reviews from Google Play for CBE, BOA, and Dashen Bank apps.
* Clean and preprocess raw textual data for NLP tasks.
* Conduct sentiment analysis to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
* Perform thematic analysis using topic modeling (e.g., k-means on TF-IDF vectors).
* Present key trends and insights using dynamic visualizations.
* Offer an extensible, reproducible pipeline that can be adapted to other fintech domains.

## 🚀 Implemented Features

### 📝 Review Analysis System

* **Text Preprocessing**: Converts text to lowercase, removes noise (e.g., punctuation, numbers), and eliminates stopwords.
* **Tokenization**: Splits text into meaningful words or phrases.
* **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their base forms using NLTK.
* **Deduplication**: Filters out repeated reviews based on unique identifiers.
* **Missing Data Handling**: Drops or imputes missing values.

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis Engine

* **Model**: Uses pre-trained `distilbert-base-uncased` from HuggingFace.
* **Classification**: Categorizes reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.
* **Trend Aggregation**: Sentiment trends are visualized over time or by app.
* **Validation**: Cross-validated model accuracy and sample predictions.

### 🎯 Theme Detection Module

* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical format based on term importance.
* **Clustering**: Applies k-means to group reviews into dominant themes.
* **Labeling**: Automatically labels clusters based on top keywords.
* **Visualization**: Displays word clouds and frequency plots of themes.

### 📊 Visualization Dashboard

* **Sentiment Trends**: Time series of sentiment distribution.
* **Pie Charts**: Proportional breakdown of sentiment labels.
* **Bar Graphs**: Frequency of key themes and issues.
* **Heatmaps**: Comparative theme analysis across different apps.

## 🧱 Technical Architecture

* **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
* **Libraries**:

  * **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
  * **NLP**: NLTK, Scikit-learn, HuggingFace Transformers
  * **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and reporting
* **Project Layout**: Modular architecture to enable testing, reuse, and scaling
